# My recipes (JOBarcelona '23)

## Background |

The project is a NUWE's challenge for entering the JOBarcelona '23 Hackathon

## Usage

App for querying the Spoonacular's API. You can enter any term in the searchbar and the app will show you a group of cards with the API's response. In this case, we're interested in the recipe's ingredients and if the recipe is vegan or veggie. You can filter the recipes by wether they are veggies or vegans. Also, you can navigate to a dynamic route with each recipe. There you can see the recipe's ingredients and go back to the home page.

## Installation

```shell
    # run commands
    npm run start

```

## Stack

- Typescript: we use Typescript because we think that coding with it help us avoid bugs.
- NextJS: React's framework that helps us creating a structure and has a great routing system.
- React: it helps us creating reusable components.
- TailwindCSS: CSS framework.
